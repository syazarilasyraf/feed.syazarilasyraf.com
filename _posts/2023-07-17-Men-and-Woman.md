Men and woman just need to stop playing the "we have it worse card" because you can't compare those two at all.

Women are biologically different and are wired differently when it comes to emotions.

Any good and honest person will have it hard. 

Any good and hard working person will have it hard.

It doesn't matter if you are giving birth to a child or pushing steel all day.

Bad things happen to good people.

I think women need to stop being so hard on men when it comes to their mental health but I think men also need to understand that good women don't have it easy either.
