I don’t like the idea of falling in love.
I prefer to look at love as commitment, an everyday decision. And that takes effort, time patience, humanity and trust. It’s not about falling, it’s about growing-
Growing in love.
Now that’s better.
If your concept of love is based entirely on feelings, then you are bound to fall over and over, and it’s just going to hurt each and every time.
The thing about growth is that it’s doesn’t happen overnight, it has to be cultivated, taken care of, given time, even pruned. But when it does happen, it certainly lasts.
This is why as cliché as it seems, I still believe in the foundation called friendship.
Save yourself from the unnecessary heartbreak.
These things take time. Love is not a feeling, it is an act of self-giving. And let me tell you this, you can’t give yourself if you don’t own yourself.
So make the most of what you have. Open up. Discover who you truly are. Surround yourself with friends and family. Know your worth in God. Find your sense of security there. Allow yourself to love and be loved.
And keep. On. Growing.
