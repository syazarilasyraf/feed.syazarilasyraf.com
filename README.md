Welcome to feed.syazarilasyraf.com! This is my personal digital notes aggregator website, where I collect and share interesting notes I find online.

## Overview

- **Notes**: Explore various digital notes that I've curated from different sources across the web.

## Design Inspiration

This siteâ€™s design is based on feed.nmoo.dev, which I adapted with some tweaks to fit my own use case. Full credit to their excellent original design.

## Technologies

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

One unique feature of this platform is the ability to post notes directly from the Obsidian.

I explained how i do this on this [post](https://syazarilasyraf.com/breaking-the-cliche-of-your-personal-website).
