The design of this site is inspired by [feed.nmoo.dev](https://feed.nmoo.dev/), with modifications to suit my preferences and needs.

## Technologies

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with design inspiration taken from feed.nmoo.dev.

One unique feature of this platform is the ability to post notes directly from the Obsidian.
