<p>What is your definition of retirement?</p>

<p>Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.</p>

<p>How do you get there?</p>

<p>Well, one way is to have so much money saved that your passive income (without you lifting a finger) covers your burn rate.</p>

<p>A second is you just drive your burn rate down to zero you become a monk.</p>

<p>A third is you’re doing something you love. You enjoy it so much, it’s not about the money. So there are multiple ways to retirement.</p>
