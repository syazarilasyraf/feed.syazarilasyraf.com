<p>In 1939, as part of creating a time capsule, the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company requested Albert Einstein to write a message intended for the populace of the year AD 6939. Einstein responded with:</p>

<p>Our time is rich in inventive minds, the inventions of which could facilitate our lives considerably. We are crossing the seas by power and utilize power also in order to relieve humanity from all tiring muscular work. We have learned to fly and we are able to send messages and news without any difficulty over the entire world through electric waves.</p>

This is due to the fact that the intelligence character of the masses are incomparably lower than the intelligence and character of the few who produce some thing valuable for the community.</p>

<p>I trust that posterity will read these statements with a feeling of proud and justified superiority.</p>
