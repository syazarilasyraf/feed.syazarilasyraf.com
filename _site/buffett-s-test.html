<p>In 2001, Warren Buffett gave a talk at the University of Georgia.</p>

<p>He asked them the most Warren Buffett question ever:</p>

<p>• If you could invest in a friend and get 10% of their income for life – who would you pick?</p>

<p>Once the students answered the question, he then asked this:</p>

<p>• Why would you invest in that person?
• What character traits do they have?</p>

<p>Now they have a list of character traits to adopt.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Buffett asked:</p>

<p>If you could short a friend’s earnings, who would you pick and why?</p>

<p>Now you have a list of character traits to avoid.</p>

<p>1- Do not think this thought experiment is only about money.</p>

<p>You can use it for whatever currency you value.</p>

<p>E.g. Happiness coin</p>

<p>If you could get 10% of a friend’s happiness, who would you invest in and why?</p>

<p>If you could short someone’s happiness, who would you pick and why?</p>

<p>You can run the same thought experiment with Fitness coin, Friendship coin, Romance coin, etc`</p>

<p>2- This thought experiment is genius because it hacks a bug in life’s video game:</p>

<p>Humans are terrible at self-awareness.</p>

<p>But we are great at spotting things in other people.</p>

<p>E.g. If your friend is in the wrong relationship, you can realize in 10 minutes what may take them 10 years.</p>

<p>Daniel Kahneman summarised his book on cognitive biases with the following:</p>

<p>“The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.” - Daniel Kahneman</p>

<p>3- Nuance - It has to be purely from merit.</p>

<p>Buffett says it can’t be because someone will inherit a large sum from their parents.</p>

<p>It has to be based on their behavior.</p>

<p>E.g. If you want 10% of someone’s fitness coin, it’s not because of incredible genetics – is because of the actions they take</p>
